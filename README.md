# rpmbuild

Just a collection of random spec files intended for people who know what to do with them. They are usually tested on Centos 5.x and Fedora (both x86_64 only). I try to maintain a level of conformity with Red Hat/Fedora packaging standards using rpmlint but I rarely come out without any warnings.

Free for re-use.
